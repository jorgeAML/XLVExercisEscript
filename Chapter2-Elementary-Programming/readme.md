### 2.1 Convert celsius to Fahrenheit
Write a program that reads a a Celsius degree in a *double* value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:

> Fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32

*Hint: In java 9/5 is 1, but 9.0/5 is 1.8.* Here is a sample run

>Enter a degree in Celsius: 43
>
>43 Celsius is 109.4 Fahrenheit.

### 2.2 Compute the volume of a cylinder
Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:

| Area | Volume |
| ---- | ------ |
| radius * radius * PI | area * radius |

Here is a sample run:

> Enter the radius and length of a cylinder: **5.5 12**
>
> The area is 95.0331
>
> The volume is 1140.4

### 2.5 Financial application: calculate tips
Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the user enters **10** for subtotal and **15%** for gratuity rate, the program displays **$1.5** as gratuity and **$11.5** as total. Here is a sample run:

>Enter the subtotal and the gratuity rate: 10 15
>
>The gratuity is $1.5 and total is $11.5
