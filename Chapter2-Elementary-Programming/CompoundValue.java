/**Financial application: Compound Value 
 * Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with annual interest rate 5%. 
 * Thus the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value 
 * in the account becomes:
 * 100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
 * after the second month, the value in the account becomes 
 * (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
 * After the third month, the value in the account becomes
 * (100 + 202.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
 * and so on.
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and
 * displays the account value after six month. (In exercise 5.30 you will use a loop to simply
 * the code and display the account value for any month).
