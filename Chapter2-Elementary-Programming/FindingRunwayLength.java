/**Physics: Finding runway length 
 * Given the airplane acceleration 'a' and take off speed 'v' you can compute the minimum runway
 * length needed for an airplane to take-off using  the following formula:
 * length = v^2 /2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter 'v' in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration 'a'
 * in meter/seconds squared (m/s^2), and displays the minimum runway length.
