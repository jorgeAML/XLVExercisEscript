ok guys I hope to end this chapter in one week! so wish me luck
### 5.1 Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers
Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and the average of the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0. Display the average as a floating-point number. Here is a sample run:

>Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 -1 3 0
>
>The number of positives is: 3
>
>The number of negatoves is: 1
>
>The total is: 5.0
>
>The average is 1.25

>Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 0
>
>No numbers are entered expected 0
