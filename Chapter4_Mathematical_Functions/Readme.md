### 4.1 Geometry: Area of a pentagon
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of the pentagon. The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is:

> Area = 5 * S*^2 / 4 * tan(PI/5)

Where *s* is the lenght of a side. The side can be computed using the formula:

> s = 2r sin PI/5

Where *r* is the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex. Round up two digits after the decimal point. Here is a sample run:

>Enter the length from the center to a vertex: 5.5
> The area of the pentagon is 71.92
