### 4.1 Geometry: Area of a pentagon
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of the pentagon. The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is:

> Area = 5 * S*^2 / 4 * tan(PI/5)

Where *s* is the lenght of a side. The side can be computed using the formula:

> s = 2r sin PI/5

Where *r* is the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex. Round up two digits after the decimal point. Here is a sample run:

>Enter the length from the center to a vertex: 5.5
> The area of the pentagon is 71.92

### 4.8 Find the character of an ASCII code
Write a program that receives an ASCII code (an integer between 0 and 127) and displays its character. Here is a sample run:

>Enter an ASCII code: 69
>The character for ASCII code is 69 is E

### 4.11 Decimal to Hex
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer between 0 and 15, and displays its corresponding hex number. Here are some sample runs:

>Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 11
>The hex values is B.

>Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 5
>The hex value is 5.

>Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 31
>31 is an invalid input
