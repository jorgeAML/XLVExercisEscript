### Hometask 3 - reverse
1. Develop a Reverse class that reads numbers from standard input, and outputs them to standard output in reverse order.
2. Each input line contains a certain number of integers (maybe 0). The numbers are separated by spaces. Each number is placed in the int type.
3. The order of the lines in the output must be reversed from the order of the lines in the input. The order of the numbers in each row must also be the reverse of the order of the numbers in the input.
4. The input contains no more than 106 numbers and strings.
5. To read numbers, use the Scanner class.
6. Examples of how the program works:

>input: 1 2 3
>
>output: 3 2 1

>input: 3 2 1
>
>output: 1 2 3

>input: 1 2 -3
>
>output: -3 2 1

>input: 1 2 3 4
>
>output: 4 3 2 1
